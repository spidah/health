    Either select &quot;Add Food&quot; from the meals menu:<br />
    <%= image_tag('help/foods-menu-add.jpg', :alt => 'Adding a new food', :class => 'help') %><br />
    or click &quot;add another&quot; in the foods lists if you've already added foods:<br />
    <%= image_tag('help/foods-list-add.jpg', :alt => 'Adding a new food', :class => 'help') %><br />
    This takes you to a page where you can enter the foods information:<br />

    The name and calories values are the most important ones. The name allows you to distinguish the foods from each
    other, and the calories allows the meal calorie totals to be calculated correctly. The other values are more for
    your own benefit, especially the description and manufacturer. You could have several foods listed as yogurt
    but different flavours in the description, or different types of pasta made by different companies.
    The fat, protein, and carbohydrates values are not currently used for anything other than for your own records.
    These values might be used in the future though, so if you can enter the values then you should do so.

  <p>Once you have entered everything, click &quot;Save&quot;, and you will be taken back to the foods list.</p>
